# Stock-Trading

This project was created to simulate a trading environment. Users can sign up or log in to access their stock portfolio. Users can buy and sell stocks with real-time data provided by iexcloud.io. Additionally, users can view their portfolio at the home screen to see the profit/loss from each of their stocks and also their portfolio value. Upon creating an account, users recieve $10,000 to start their trading journey! Lastly, users can also view their history of stock purchases and sellings. 

The website is just a simulation and you do not have to provide real money.
