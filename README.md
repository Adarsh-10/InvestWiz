# Stock Trading Simulator

This project was created to simulate a trading environment and recreate the buying/selling experience of trading stocks in real life! Additionally, all the stock prices are real-time meaning the exact prices of all stocks are used in this web application. This project is merely a simulation, so you do not need to worry about putting your own money for investment! You will be provided with $10,000 (fake money, of course) at the start upon successful registration. After signing up, you can embark on your simulated trading journey! If you would like to view the various pages of the application and a more detailed explanation scroll down!

<h1>Home Page</h1>

This is the home page of a new account! This is where the user's portfolio is shown in a table with 5 columns. The first column displays the symbol of the stock (AAPL for Apple, WMT for Walmart, etc). The next column displays the actual name of the company. The third column shows the number of stocks bought for that company. The next column shows the value of each stock at the current time (not the time of purchase). The last columns shows the total value of all the stocks from a certain company. This number is calculated buy multiplying the number of stocks (Column 3) by the value of one stock at the current time (Column 4). The row saying "CASH" is the number of money you have left after spending on stocks. At the bottom right of the table, the value of the Portfolio is displayed. This value represents the amount of money you would have if you were to sell all your stocks at that time. As said before, all users start off with $10,000 to begin their trading journey. Currently the user has not invested in anything yet which is why their total is still $10,000. Below is what the home page may look like for a user that has already invested!

As you can see above, the portfolio shows all the different stocks the user has bought. In this case, the user has bought 16 Apple shares with a value of $125.43	each and 3 Walmart shares for $141.75	each. The user had started with $10,000 and over time, the price of the stocks increased a bit so the user's portfolio value is now at $10,087.86. After buying all the Apple and Walmart stocks, the user has $7,655.73 in cash. Remember, the user has not sold their stocks yet which is why their "CASH" value is less. If they choose to sell a stock, the money would be added to their "CASH".
