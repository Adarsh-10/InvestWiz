# Stock Trading Simulator

This project was created to simulate a trading environment and recreate the buying/selling experience of trading stocks in real life! Additionally, all the stock prices are real-time meaning the exact prices of all stocks are used in this web application. This project is merely a simulation, so you do not need to worry about putting your own money for investment! You will be provided with $10,000 (fake money, of course) at the start upon successful registration. After signing up, you can embark on your simulated trading journey! If you would like to view the various pages of the application and a more detailed explanation scroll down!

This is the home page of a new account! This is where the user's portfolio is shown in a table. As said before, all users start off with $10,000 to begin their trading journey. Currently the user has not invested in anything yet which is why their total is still $10,000. Below is whatthe home page may look like for a user that has already invested.
